# cluster_model_building

Overview In this project, you'll use data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances. First, you'll identify households that have a hard time getting credit. Then you'll build a model to segment these households into subgroups. Finally, you'll create an interactive web app to share your work.

This project is an example of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering. It can be used in commercial contexts for marketing or customer segmentation or in sociological contexts to study social stratification.

Once you complete this project, you'll be able to:

Compare characteristics across subgroups using a side-by-side bar chart. Build a k-means clustering model. Conduct feature selection for clustering based on variance. Reduce high-dimensional data using principal component analysis (PCA). Design, build and deploy a Dash web application. If you're interested in learning more about this dataset, or clustering in general, some projects that served as inspiration for this project are:
